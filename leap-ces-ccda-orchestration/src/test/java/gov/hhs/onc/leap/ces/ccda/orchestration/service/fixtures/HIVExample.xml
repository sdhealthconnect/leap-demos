                                        *** GI - E-CONSULT Has ADDENDA ***

                                        Reason For Request:
                                        pt with ho rectoal cancer, sp resection/ostomy
                                        noted some blood in ostomy bag by report
                                        not orthostatic,
                                        stool green today
                                        hct stable 38(fri), 39 today
                                        ostomy area  looks pink
                                        ho erosive esophagitis admis(on omeprazole) no n/v
                                        should his ostomy be scoped?

                                        70 yo male with presumed ileostomy after resection of sigmoid/rectal cancer in
                                        2014. BAsed on my review of the op notes, he had an end to end anastomosis of
                                        desc colon to rectal area, and had a postop complication of evisceration. I
                                        assume that now he has double barrel ileostomy???   At any rate, I don't know
                                        that he needs an urgent eval for bleeding, but would like for the ostomy nurse
                                        to look at the stoma for skin irritation, evidence of bleeding at the level of
                                        the skin. He is due for a 1 year exam post surgery ; I think he still has colon
                                        left. Will ask Dr. Lu to clarify for me.

                                        To perform an exam through his ileostomy, he will need a regular prep and I
                                        would suggest enemas x 2 from below. (if possible).  He would also benefit from
                                        MAC anesthesia since he has pain issues/meds.

                                        REASON FOR VISIT/CHIEF COMPLAINT:
                                        fu
                                        pt had been in a care facility for  quite some time, rehab, and admitte dto the
                                        hospital x 2, dx with uti and pneumonia but symptoms completely resolved,
                                        unclear if he had either of these as was not sen hom on abx
                                        here to day to reestablish care, has not acute complaints
                                        has chronic back pain but basically sits around all day long
                                        denies depression but "just doesn't care" to do anything, not smoking or
                                        drinking
                                        living with x-wife now(just staying at her house) but not sure what the future
                                        holds. would like ot live in a little apt by himself but has no plans for how to
                                        do that
                                        has no tranproration of his own, but does have honored citizesns pass and dav as
                                        needed, has a hard time walking to the bus stop

                                        taking his medications and brought them in except the atorvastatin so unsure if
                                        he is taking them
                                        does have a hard time taking medicaiton more than once daily

                                        states he did have some pain medication when he was in the care center, but from
                                        interviews I don't see that he was anymore functional then than now.
                                        pt is not motivated to get stronger, and be more funcitonal even with a goal of
                                        living on his own
                                        pt basically eats tv dinner and fast food, not motivated to make changes

                                        SOCIAL WORK TRIAGE ASSESSMENT

                                        Referral source:   Provider

                                        Presenting issues:   Transportation

                                        Brief summary:
                                        PC Social Worker received an alert from Veteran's PCP because Veteran missed
                                        his PCP appointment.  PCP spoke to Veteran who reported that he did not come to
                                        his scheduled appointment because of lack of transportation.


                                        Is case management recommended?
                                        No

                                        Social Work Interventions and Plan:
                                        PC Social Worker contacted Veteran via the phone.  Veteran advised this writer
                                        that he attempted to arrange transportation via Medicaid transportation, but
                                        that he couldn't because they were unable to verify his PCP appointment.  Social
                                        Worker helped Veteran contact Medicaid Transportation via conference call.  The
                                        Medicaid Transportation representative advised this writer and Veteran that
                                        Veteran never called Medicaid Transportation to arrange transportation.  Social
                                        Worker helped Veteran make travel arrangements for his next PCP appointment on
                                        10/19/2015 @ 1115.   Provided Veteran with the phone number to Medicaid
                                        transportation for his reference.


                                        Time spent with the veteran for this encounter: 30 minutes.

                                        Presenting issues:   Transportation

                                        Brief summary:
                                        PC Social Worker received an alert from Veteran's RN stating that Veteran does
                                        not have transportation to get to and from his medical appointment.


                                        Is case management recommended?
                                        No


                                        Social Work Interventions and Plan:
                                        Veteran is covered by Medicaid at this time.  PC Social Worker contacted the
                                        Medicaid Transportation number which is 503-416-3955 and Veteran is eligible for
                                        transportation via his Medicaid for all medical appointments.   Social Worker
                                        contacted Veteran and provided him with the above number.  Advised Veteran to
                                        call number to arrange transportation when he has a medical appointment.
                                        Veteran agreed to plan.


                                        Time spent with the veteran for this encounter: 15  minutes.

                                        pt said he called for transportaiton but they wouldn't provide it because he
                                        didn't have an appointment scheduled.
                                        I am not sure when the appointmnetn appeared in CPRS
                                        I told him that we would reschedule his appointment

                                        DC PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: UTI, LLL pneumonia, Generalized Weakness

                                        TC to pt for DC f/u.

                                        Pt reports he is improving very slowly, but still feels very weak, walking short
                                        distances 6-10 feet, gets exhausted easily, denies balance issues, but notes his
                                        walker was lost when he was at OHSU some time ago. Pt is home bound, reports he
                                        is not able to get out of house without medical transport. His breathing is
                                        improved overall, still coughing frequently, clear/white sputum.

                                        Pt states he didn't know he had UTI, denies dysuria, fever/chills. He is
                                        mentally clear by his account, although he seemed delayed in some responses,
                                        answers to questions were appropriate but had difficulty recalling some details
                                        of his recent hospitalization. I am not sure if this is his baseline.

                                        Pt states he does ostomy care independently .

                                        Pt has prescriptions for following meds he would like to have filled through VA:

                                        81mg ASA daily
                                        Oxycodone 5mg 1-2 tabs q4 hrs

                                        Tamsulosin 4mg 1 cap HS

                                        PC: 1) I have scheduled pt for next available PC appt 10/19, do we need to make
                                        other arrangements ie sooner interim visit?

                                        2) Pt will need HH, with OT/PT and needs a new walker, I see cons ordered
                                        already.

                                        3) Alert me for planning around medications, or if any other questions.

                                        Providence city136 Hospital ED Social Worker:  Karen:  503-513-8320

                                        Presenting issues:   Housing

                                        Brief summary:
                                        PC Social Worker received a phone call from a ED Social Worker from
                                        Providence city136 Hospital stating that Veteran was "kicked out" from an
                                        ICF (Pacific Health and Rehab:  503-639-1144) and is now at the ED with a box
                                        of his belongings.   His ex-wife is not allowing Veteran back into their
                                        home, because she cannot care for him.

                                        Is case management recommended?
                                        No

                                        Social Work Interventions and Plan:
                                        Patient is a 70 year old NSC Vietnam Era Veteran.  Veteran receives
                                        $1113.00 a month from VA Pension and income from Social Security.  Veteran's
                                        monthly income is $1700.00 a month.   Social Worker reviewed the Veteran's
                                        CPRS records and appears that Veteran was discharged from ICF on 09/03/2015
                                        to his ex-wife's home with Home Health follow-up.  Does not appear that
                                        Veteran was "kicked out" of the facility.  Veteran has been involved with APS
                                        in the past.
                                        Social Worker did contact the Social Worker at Pacific Health and Rehab
                                        (Celeste) who stated that Veteran was discharged from the facility, because
                                        he refused to pay the facility his liability copay.  Veteran is on Medicaid
                                        and because of his income he had to pay the facility a certain liability.
                                        Veteran owes the facility $4,000-$5,000 which he refused to pay.  Celeste
                                        advised Social Worker that Veteran does have over $5,000 in his bank account
                                        and could have easily paid the facility.   Veteran's Medicaid Worker is Kurt
                                        Garcia (503-624-4363) who works out of the Tigard DHS Office.
                                        Celeste advised this writer that Veteran is able to walk at least 100 feet
                                        with his rollator walker, is able to manage his ostomy bag, needs set up to
                                        shower, limited assist with putting on clothes (cannot put on his socks), and
                                        is able to groom himself.  Celeste advised this writer that the Veteran
                                        assured the facility that his ex-wife would be able to care for him and that
                                        he had a safe d/c plan.
                                        Social Worker advised Karen to contact APS and make them aware of
                                        Veteran's current situation and that Veteran is now homeless.  Social Worker
                                        advised Karen that Veteran will not qualify for VA contract placement because
                                        he is not Mill Bill eligible.  Veteran has the funds to pay for a motel or
                                        SRO if needed.   Encouraged Karen to call the Veteran's Medicaid worker for
                                        further assistance.

                                        Time spent with the veteran for this encounter:   60  minutes.

                                        Dear Veteran,


                                        We have been unable to reach you regarding scheduling of your Ostomy
                                        appointment.  Please contact the Operative Care scheduling line at 503-721-7887
                                        or 1-800-949-1004 extension 57887 to schedule your appointment.

                                        We look forward to hearing from you soon.  If we do not hear from you within 14
                                        days of the date of this letter, your consult will be discontinued and your care
                                        will be returned to your Primary Care Provider (PCP).  If after that time you
                                        would like an appointment, you must have your Primary Care Provider (PCP) refer
                                        you back to Ostomy.


                                        Sincerely,

                                        04/10/2015 ADDENDUM                      STATUS: COMPLETED
                                        Social Worker received a call back from Amedisys Home Health RN Erin (541-784-
                                        5862) stating that when she arrived at the Veteran's apartment he was "sleeping
                                        on the floor, there was food all over the floor, colostomy bags on the floor,
                                        and there were unopened medication bottles".   RN did contact Multnomah County
                                        APS and Veteran's case was assigned to an APS Investigator.  Erin stated that
                                        she does not know the name of the APS Investigator assigned to Veteran's case.

                                        Social Worker reviewed Veteran's clinical records.  Veteran doesn't qualify for
                                        Medicaid as he doesn't have ADL needs and doesn't qualify for OPI because he is
                                        over income. Veteran's income is $1700.00 a month.

                                        Veteran may benefit from placement in an independent living facility which would
                                        take most of his income.  PC Social Worker unable to discuss directly with
                                        Veteran as he does not have a phone.  Veteran has family listed in his CPRS
                                        notes, but they are not involved with Veteran per CRRC Social Worker that worked
                                        with Veteran closely for six months.

                                        PC Social Worker did note that Veteran's landlord, Dennis Tatum (503-995-8664)
                                        is involved with Veteran and supportive.  Social Worker left a message with
                                        landlord to determine if Veteran is willing to move into a facility, waiting for
                                        a call back.

                                        *** CLC - SOCIAL WORK NOTE Has ADDENDA ***

                                        Provided the following case management services to veteran today:
                                        Telephone Calls or Forms on behalf of patient.

                                        Received call from veteran's landlord, Dennis Tatum, 503-995-8664, stating that
                                        he is taking veteran to the DMV to get a new ID card and then to bank today to
                                        pay rent, but on the way, veteran has experienced bowel leakage from his ostomy.
                                        Dennis is asking if he should take veteran to the ED.  I explained that I cannot
                                        give medical advice, but a bowel accident isn't an emergency and there are plans
                                        in place to help veteran manage his care at home.  Dennis was not sure if the
                                        home health agency has been able to meet with veteran yet since his discharge
                                        from OHSU.

                                        Called and spoke with Courtney at Amedysis Home Health (503) 253-5155.  Courtney
                                        states that they have tried 5 different phone numbers to reach veteran with no
                                        luck.  Gave Courtney Dennis Tatum's phone number so that they can arrange a time
                                        for Home Health nurse to meet with veteran hopefully today.  Courtney states
                                        that they will also send out their social worker to assist with higher level of
                                        care needs.

                                        Dennis also reports that veteran would like to move to higher level of care.
                                        Veteran is stating that he cannot manage at home alone.  When veteran was
                                        admitted to OHSU, this SW spoke with OHSU social worker and case manager and was
                                        told that according to their information, veteran would not qualify for Medicaid
                                        due to his income of $1700.  So they were unable to assist veteran with higher
                                        level of care apparently and sent him home with home health.  This SW will
                                        contact DHS to initiate referral and hopefully they will be able to assist
                                        veteran with achieving his goal of increased care.

                                        Will add PC SW to this note for follow up.

                                        Brief summary:
                                        PC Social Worker received a phone call from OHSU RN Case-Manager asking if the
                                        CLC is an option for Veteran.  Veteran is currently a patient at OHSU needing
                                        placement.

                                        Is case management recommended?
                                        No

                                        Social Work Interventions and Plan:
                                        Social Worker provided Julian with the latest CLC update stating that Veteran
                                        is on the waitlist for CLC placement, however placement appears unlikely.  CLC
                                        unable to take Veteran unless he has a skilled need and engages in care. Social
                                        Worker was advised by Julian that Veteran is unable/unwilling to engage in
                                        ostomy care including touching the bag or emptying contents.  In addition,
                                        Veteran is reportedly not participating with PT or OT.    OHSU RN Case-Manager
                                        is currently pursuing LTC placement and care for Veteran.  Veteran receives
                                        $1587 a month from VA Pension and Social Security Retirement.   Veteran may
                                        qualify for Medicaid if he agrees to an income cap trust.  Encouraged Julian to
                                        pursue Medicaid for Veteran and to fax recent PT/OT notes to the VA Access Line
                                        for review.

                                        Provided the following case management services to veteran today:
                                        Discharge Planning and Care Coordination.
                                        Telephone Calls or Forms on behalf of patient.

                                        Spoke with OHSU case manager Vijay 503-494-8187 regarding veteran's care and
                                        discharge plans.  Vijay reports that veteran is participating more in his care.
                                        He is asking to participate in his own ostomy care, which is different than
                                        during his CLC admission.  He is also stating that he needs a wedge for his bed
                                        at home as his mattress is on the floor and he cannot see his ostomy when lying
                                        flat.  He seems to be engaging more in his care at this point.  OHSU is still
                                        working on discharge plans which include possible admission to CLC or return
                                        home directly with home health.

                                        Called surgery scheduling.  Veteran now has an appointment with Dr. Lu,
                                        colorectal surgeon, to discuss possible takedown of ostomy.  Appointment
                                        scheduled for 4/22 at 9am.

                                        Called and spoke with landlord Dennis Tatum 503-995-8664, regarding veteran's
                                        apartment and requirements for being able to return home.  Dennis is requesting
                                        a written statement from the veteran allowing landlord to enter apartment to
                                        clean up garbage to avoid bugs.

                                        Relayed this information to Vijay at OHSU so he can assist veteran with
                                        discharge planning.

                                        PC Social Worker advised that Veteran needs skilled nursing care from OHSU RN
                                        Case-Manage:  Vijay.  Veteran was discharged from the CLC on 03/12/2015 after a
                                        three month rehab stay in the setting of recent colostomy, wound dehiscence, and
                                        delirium.  Veteran admitted to OHSU on 03/17/2015 due to SOB and weakness.
                                        Veteran does not have any health insurance.  Social Worker did contact the
                                        Medical Verification Line and was advised that Veteran does not have Medicare.

                                        Social Worker placed a CLC referral and made the CLC Admissions Coordinator
                                        aware of request.

                                        Received phone call from veteran's landlord yesterday, Dennis Tatum
                                        503-995-8664, stating that veteran had refused to let the home health nurse into
                                        his home on Saturday 3/14 (the day after CLC discharge).  Dennis states that he
                                        has seen veteran out on the curb trying to get a cab to take him to the grocery
                                        store.  Dennis states that Connected Home Health is planning to send out another
                                        nurse 3/17 at 4pm.

                                        Spoke with Dennis again today after learning that veteran is now hospitalized at
                                        OHSU.  Dennis says he didn't know that veteran had been taken to the hospital on
                                        Monday evening, but he called around to various hospitals after discovering that
                                        veteran had left his apartment open with TV on, but was not home.  Dennis states
                                        that there were heavily soiled clothes on the floor directly inside the doorway.
                                        Dennis called Connected Home Health to inform them that veteran is now at OHSU.

                                        Veteran was reluctant to participate in changing and caring for his ostomy
                                        during admission here at the CLC.  Home health was ordered to check in on him at
                                        home to make sure things were going ok.  He would benefit from higher level of
                                        care as he continues to not be able to manage his personal care on his own.  He
                                        refused to consider this option during his CLC admission.

                                        Vet still not participating in ostomy care at OHSU despite repeated attempts to
                                        educate by ostomy nurses there.  Per records, Vet had pastissues with follow
                                        through and compliance with some aspects of care (medications, etc). CLC not
                                        able to take Vet back and he is currently failure to thrive not willing to do
                                        any ostomy care or emptying of bag etc on his own.

                                        OHSU is now pursuing medicaid for LTC placement and care for this Veteran, with
                                        goal that nutritional status will improve enough for consideration of ostomy
                                        reversal and move back toward independent living.

                                        CM will keep updated with d/c plan.

                                        Clinical Notes:


                                        TC from Julian OHSU CM  503-418-4003.

                                        Vet remains in house needing placement due to inability to return home with
                                        colostomy and needing PT/OT services.  Vet has not been willing to engage in
                                        ostomy care ever since his surgery, stating to previous CM " they told me they
                                        were going to take the cancer out, they never told me I would be left with this
                                        thing".  Mentally unable/unwilling to engage in any ostomy cere including touching
                                        the bag or emptying contents. Was at CLC for 6 months and after d/c HH attempted
                                        to have him engage in care but was unwilling.  Also has not engaged in ostomy care
                                        since admit to OHSU, despite repeated efforts from ostomy nurses.

                                        Note from Gen Surg indicated possible reversal if nutritional status improves.  A
                                        reversal may be one way he is able to return to independent living.  Another CLC
                                        consult was placed but not able to take him unless he has a skilled need and
                                        engages in care.  CM had initiated medicaid referral, however notes show he makes
                                        too much money with VA pension to be eligible for medicaid for LTC placement, even
                                        though he did agree to LTC placement last week.

                                        CM requesting recommendation for any VA services or options that would allow Vet
                                        to be placed or discharged safely.  Contact information given for PCSW and CLC
                                        coordinator to discuss.  Also adised to fax updated clinical records and PT/OT
                                        notes for review.

                                        Forwarding to PCSW and Cancer Care coordinator for review and to f/u with CM with
                                        any VA options or suggestions for safe discharge plan.

                                        Requested to be faxed to ACCESS Department.
                                        Alerting PSA to please request summary of this hospital stay

                                        Plan discussed with:
                                        Case manager
                                        Julian 503-418-4003

                                        Discharge Disposition:
                                        Home
                                        Per notes, unsafe discharge situation as he has no support at home or in the
                                        community.  Has become weaker due to not engaging in PT/OT and though possible
                                        barriers to this discussed, he is unclear as to why he is not participating
                                        other than being depressed.  Declines treatment for depression, stating its not
                                        bad enough for treatment.  Vet usually takes a taxi to the store and meds are
                                        mailed to him by the VA.  Still not participating in colostomy care including
                                        unwillingness to empty it or touch the bag.  Deemed by hospitalist to be
                                        competent to make his own decisions at this time.  Vet states he does NOT want
                                        to return to the CLC, even if bed made available, though is agreeable to ICF
                                        level of care in the community.

                                        Per OHSU CM director, due to inablity to qualify for medicaid and no other
                                        options for LTC placement, plan is to d/c to home with HH support. OHSU tried to
                                        get him meals on wheels but he refused saying "they only have vegetables and he
                                        doesnt eat vegetables".  OHSU paid for a new cell phone for him so he could get
                                        in contact with pcp, as he reports not having a phone.  The phone number for new
                                        cell phone is 503-593-2792.  Will add to record.
                                        ******Will ask PCSW to assist with obtaining travel to and from VA appts and any
                                        possible H/HHA or other benefit he may qualify for through the VA.

                                            Reason For Request:
                                            pt with ho rectoal cancer, sp resection/ostomy
                                            noted some blood in ostomy bag by report
                                            not orthostatic,
                                            stool green today
                                            hct stable 38(fri), 39 today
                                            ostomy area  looks pink
                                            ho erosive esophagitis admis(on omeprazole) no n/v
                                            should his ostomy be scoped?

                                            70 yo male with presumed ileostomy after resection of sigmoid/rectal cancer in
                                            2014. BAsed on my review of the op notes, he had an end to end anastomosis of
                                            desc colon to rectal area, and had a postop complication of evisceration. I
                                            assume that now he has double barrel ileostomy???   At any rate, I don't know
                                            that he needs an urgent eval for bleeding, but would like for the ostomy nurse
                                            to look at the stoma for skin irritation, evidence of bleeding at the level of
                                            the skin. He is due for a 1 year exam post surgery ; I think he still has colon
                                            left. Will ask Dr. Lu to clarify for me.

                                            To perform an exam through his ileostomy, he will need a regular prep and I
                                            would suggest enemas x 2 from below. (if possible).  He would also benefit from
                                            MAC anesthesia since he has pain issues/meds.

                                        PRIOR MOBILITY:
                                        Previously, pt lived independently in studio apartment.  Primarily uses
                                        rollator.  At baseline, pt ambulates with forearms on rollator to unload
                                        back
                                        weight.  No stairs to enter.  Pt no longer drives.  Took taxis to
                                        appointments.  Used store power scooters for shopping.

                                        D/C  LOCATION:
                                        It is unlikely pt will be able to return to independent living.  Recommend
                                        nursing home facility placement.

                                        SUBJECTIVE:
                                        "I don't want to do anything.  I want to get out of here.  This place is
                                        stupid.  I don't want any therapy."
                                        PAIN:
                                        not numerically rated.  Ambulated with bilateral forearms on rollator to
                                        relieve back pain.
                                        OBJECTIVE:
                                        Pt was very uninterested during conversation.  Little to no eye contact.
                                        Spoke in whispers barely audible.  Appeared agitated with no interest in
                                        participating in evaluation or on going therapy.

                                        COGNITION:
                                        AO x 3

                                        Extra time and effort to complete all tasks.  Pt appeared to understand
                                        commands but was reluctant/resistant to complete or participate.

                                        ASSESSMENT:
                                        ONE TIME VISIT ONLY.  Pt is 69 yo male presenting with deconditioning 2/2 a
                                        prolonged and complicated hospital stay.  On 10/02/14 pt underwent a low
                                        anterior resection (tumor-specific mesorectal excision), construction
                                        of a right-sided ileostomy.  Excision of an umbilical hernia sac, and
                                        primary umbilical hernia repair on 10/03/2014.  The patient was doing
                                        well until he had more abdominal pain found to have drainage from his
                                        incision, and then he eviscerated underwent ex lap on 10/10/14.  Pt has spent
                                        most of his time in bed since these procedures.  Pt is not interested in
                                        physical therapy.  Pt has a h/o refusals of prior PT attempts and marginally
                                        participates in OT.  Pt had little/no eye contact during evaluation.
                                        Appeared angry and very uninterested.  Offered no interest in goal setting.
                                        At this time, pt is not appropriate for skilled therapy 2/2 lack of interest
                                        and h/o refusals.  Pt is more appropriate for restorative nursing for
                                        ambulation to/from all meals to maintain current level of function.
                                        Recommend Restorative Nursing consult be placed to maintain his current level
                                        of function.  Pt stated he lives alone and wishes to return to independent
                                        living.  Pt is not appropriate to return to independent living and is more
                                        appropriate for nursing home facility placement.  No further PT needs
                                        identified.  Plan to DC from PT at this time.  Please reconsult PT if pt
                                        becomes interested in participating in ongoing skilled therapy on a
                                        consistent basis.

                                        ostomy care could not think of barriers to living independently
                                        -Insight: Pt has some insight into his deficits. Recognizes that he is
                                        not able to manage his ostomy care

                                        EDUCATION:
                                        OT Role
                                        Ward Program
                                        Learner  - patient
                                        Response - receptive to therapy as long as it is not interrupting his
                                        meals and he is aware of when it will take place



                                        ASSESSMENT: Pt is a 69 y.o. Veteran admitted to rehab s/p bowel surgery. He
                                        presents with confusion, general deconditioning, below baseline level of self
                                        care independence and need for total assist with ostomy management.
                                        Per discussion, pt is undecided about whether he plans to return home or if he
                                        will seek higher level of care.
                                        IADL goals set to reflect level of independence that will be required for pt to
                                        return to previous living situation without support, however, it is likely that
                                        pt will need a d/c environment where daily assist is available to manage his
                                        ostomy care. Anticipate IADL assist, especially med management, may also be
                                        indicated s/p discharge pending resolution of symptoms of delirium. Pt would
                                        benefit from skilled OT services for assessment of functional cogitation in
                                        ADL/IADL context and for maximizing self care independence.


                                        Patient able to participate in, and agreed to goal setting: YES.
                                        Patient goal: return home
                                        Potential: Good for stated OT goals.
                                        Barriers: pt does not think he will feel comfortable managing his own
                                        ostomy care
                                        Enhancers: Pt was cooperative today

                                        PRIOR LEVEL OF FUNCTION:  OT last saw this patient on 10-8-14.  He was willing
                                        to participate only minimally.  Per his report on that date:  Reluctant
                                        historian.  Reports living in an apartment in Portland.  Not on home O2.  Does
                                        not drive.  Takes the bus or cab to the grocery store and uses the store
                                        scooter.  Walks with a rollator walker or cane.
                                        Denies falls.  No in home services.  Keeps medications in their bottles.
                                        Independent ADLs.  Stands to shower in a stall.  Does not own a shower chair.
                                        Reports he sleeps on a mattress on the floor.

                                        ASSESSMENT:  69 y/o male s/p abdominal surgeries x 2 who has consistently
                                        declined participation with OT in spite of education provided, cajoling,
                                        promises to assist, etc.  Recommend ICF level of care.  Patient is reportedly
                                        going to the CLC, where he likely will need to stay until his wounds heal.
                                        Having him at the CLC will facilitate closer psychiatric f/u which will benefit
                                        patient.  Patient likely will need placement in LTC after delirium clears and
                                        decision making capacity r/t d/c planning can be evaluated.  OT to sign off now
                                        given patient is consistently declining participation.

                                        Pt did state yes, when I feel a little better, when asked if he was ready to
                                        learn about the stoma and how to take of the bag. Will try education of
                                        ileostomy again.

                                        Will continue to follow.

                                        REASON FOR CONSULT:
                                        Discussion of goals of care, support for emotional suffering.

                                        PCP: PHYSICIAN-ATTENDING: Carol L Sprague

                                        HPI: Mr. LN136 is a 69 y.o. man with a recent diagnosis of rectal
                                        adenocarcinoma, hospitalized since Oct 2 after undergoing resection of his
                                        rectum and sigmoid colon.  His post-operative course has been complicated by
                                        wound dehisence, depression, delirium and hallucinations-pt was on a court hold
                                        on teh psychiatry unit earlier in his hospital stay.  Now he has been refusing
                                        wound care, medications and lab draws.  Earlier today the palliative care
                                        psychology fellow attempted to engage with pt but pt refused.  I approached him
                                        later in the afternoon.  I asked him about the earlier encounter and he
                                        recoutned to me that he was angry that religion was brought up and that he
                                        didn't want to talk about that at all.  I assured him that there was no need to
                                        talk about religion.  I then proceeded to ask several questions about his
                                        understanding why he was in the hospital.  He initially stated "You know that I
                                        know why I'm in the hospital".  I told him that I am never certain what patients
                                        know unless they tell me.  He angrily told me to get out of his room and leave
                                        him alone.  I told him that I would leave later and asked additional questions.
                                        I asked him what he was hoping for and he stated "for people to leave me alone
                                        and to get well". I told him that I did not think he would be able to get well
                                        if he were completely left alone.  I asked him what he thought it would take for
                                        him to get well.  He stated "I don't know, I'm not a doctor".  I then explained
                                        that the doctors have recommended several things to try to help him to get well
                                        and he has been refusing them.  He did not respond.  I asked him why he thought
                                        the doctors were recommending various treatments (medications, wound care, lab
                                        draws).  He again stated "I don't know, I'm not a doctor".    I asked him
                                        questions to attempt to assess his cognitive function (starting wtih asking what
                                        year it is) and he refused answer, again stating that I knew that he knew this
                                        already.  I reiterated multiple times that I work with many patients in the
                                        hospital who are unable to answer these questions correctly and I am never
                                        certain which patients will be able to.  He again refused to answer.

                                        I asked if any family had visited him.  Her replied that they had not.  I asked
                                        if he had any close friends/family in the area and he stated he has a daguther
                                        and an ex-wife.  I asked if they knew that he was here and he stated that he
                                        didn't know.  I asked if I could call his daugther and he stated "sure, do
                                        whatever you want, just leave me alone".

                                        ASSESSMENT: 69 y.o. male with recent resection of rectum &amp; signmoid colon for
                                        rectal adenocarcinoma with complicated post-operative course.  Pt minimally
                                        engatged with me this afternoon.  My general impression is that he is not
                                        delirious though it is difficult to say given that he would not really engage.
                                        I am unable to assess his capacity to make decisions based on today's interview
                                        as he was either unable or unwilling to manipulate the information provided and
                                        communicate a choice.  He certainly has a history of refusing to take
                                        medications upon review of his chart from outpatient settings but I am unable to
                                        say whether he even understands the interventions/medications being offerred or
                                        recommended.  Hopefully I will be able to gather more collateral history
                                        tomorrow to better assess how we might be able to help Mr. LN136.

                                        PLAN:
                                        -Will gather further history tomorrow:
                                        --Plan to contact PCP Dr. Sprague
                                        --Plan to call pt's daugther
                                        -Depending on additional history gathered may need to re-involve psychiatry

                                        URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED

                                        Social Worker received the follow consult: "Pt request to meet with social
                                        worker"

                                        Social Worker met with Veteran who has concerns about paying his rent for the
                                        month of November.  Veteran advised Social Worker that he lives in a Studio
                                        apartment off of NE 91st and Glisan and needs to pay his rent.  Veteran reports
                                        that he left his wallet which has his bank card and ID in his apartment.

                                        Social Worker encouraged Veteran to contact his landlord and advise landlord
                                        that he is in the hospital.  Veteran stated he does not know his landlord's name
                                        of the name of his apartment complex.  Social Worker search for apartment
                                        complex online, but could not locate apartment name.

                                        Veteran gave permission for Social Worker to contact his daughter.  Daughter
                                        advised Social Worker that Veteran lives in a duplex type apartment and that it
                                        does not have a name.  She does not have the number to the Veteran's landlord
                                        and cannot help Veteran get his wallet to pay his rent.

                                        Encouraged Veteran to call friends who he trusts to advise landlord that he is
                                        in the hospital.

                                        ID / CC: 69 yo M who developed delirium 2 weeks s/p LAR for rectal
                                        adenocarcinoma was transferred to 5C on court hold, improved on Haldol so
                                        transferred to 9D with court hold removed now with delirium worsening after
                                        Haldol cessation.

                                        S: Mr. LN136 has had fluctuating delirium believed to be of multifactorial
                                        etiology that was mostly improved over the last few days so Haldol (scheduled
                                        1mg BID) was d/ced yesterday morning. Later in the day, pt began reporting that
                                        he was seeing "kitties" walking around the room. In discussing this with pt,
                                        states he has seen kittens in his room 3 or 4 times and has interacted with
                                        them, feeling them as they play with his fingers. Also notes illusions of items
                                        on the wall distorting toward him. Still feels safe in the hospital, denying
                                        that he feels anyone is coming after him. No SI, HI, AH. He agrees with need to
                                        stay in hospital, specifically states that he could not care for himself
                                        (particularly his ostomy bag) if he were outside of the hospital. Has not had
                                        elopment attempts however has been insisting to staff that he would like to go
                                        smoke downstairs whether or not an escort would take him.

                                        QTc 424 on 10/23 EKG

                                        Impression:
                                        69 yo M with fluctuating delirium in setting of complicated post-op recovery
                                        (LAR for rectal adenocarcinoma) who developed hallucinations and illusions
                                        yesterday in setting of d/ced Haldol.
                                        He is indeed still experiencing delirium which is known to have
                                        fluctuating course however question if his new hallucinations and illusions are
                                        a manifestation of his preexisting delirium revealed due to haldol cessation or
                                        if they are due to a new underlying etiology. He had not experienced
                                        hallucinations since 10/21 and had not displayed impulsivity or disorientation
                                        so his delirium seemed to be resolving as of yesterday morning. This raises
                                        concern that his new sxs could be related to a new or worsening underlying
                                        cause. Per earlier notes from consult service, head CT may be indicated if sxs
                                        do not improve as could have subacute neurologic process. Please monitor for
                                        constipation and urinary retention as these are known to precipitate delirium
                                        as well. BUN and creatinine are wnl so doubt renal failure as cause. Considered
                                        infection though his WBC count has remained normal. Would obtain a UA to r/o
                                        UTI. If leukocytosis develops, recommend considering abd etiology with imaging.
                                        Anemia has been present and is likely contributing though has not changed so
                                        doubt this is causing acute worsening of his delirium. Has had oxycodone which
                                        could precipitate delirium however he has been on relatively stable doses so
                                        doubt this is contributing to new/worsening process. No new or recently d/ced
                                        meds to our knowledge that could be contributing. Should check TSH to evaluate
                                        for endocrine etiology. Reporting that his abdomen hurts; pain is also known to
                                        precipitate delirium at times. Recent amylase normal but consider repeat if
                                        epigastric pain, NV develop. Electrolytes are largely unremarkable, continue to
                                        check and replete as necessary. Had normal B12 and Folate earlier this year so
                                        unlikely cause. Hypoxia less likely contributing as his O2 sats have been
                                        mostly stable. He has significant cardiac hx, most recent troponin and EKG
                                        normal but hypoperfusion could cause delirium so should repeat if concern for
                                        cardiac event increases. Had normal LFTs so less likely hepatic etiology. Has
                                        not had access to substances so unlikely intoxication; he is also past time
                                        timeline during which we would expect confusion due to withdrawal.
                                        At this time, pt poses little threat of elopement as he seems to be
                                        experiencing more of a hypoactive delirium. However, in anticipating potential
                                        development of this threat as occurred when he first became delirious on 10/20,
                                        would recommend reinitiating Haldol at scheduled dose as he was on until
                                        yesterday. Would encourage supportive environment including frequent
                                        reorientation, limiting lines and exposure to light during the daytime. Also
                                        recommend therapeutic companion at nursing discretion, orange pajamas to alert
                                        staff, have low threshold for capacity assessment if pt threatens to leave.
                                        Thank you for requesting our continued involvement in Mr. LN136's care, we
                                        will continue to follow.

                                        Recommendations:
                                        -Haldol 1mg PO tonight then scheduled Haldol 1mg PO BID
                                        -Pursue aggressive workup for potential causes of new/worsening delirium (UA,
                                        TSH in addition to LFTs, CBC and CMP which you have already been checking)
                                        -Head CT if pt does not improve with Haldol
                                        -Therapeutic companion at nursing discretion
                                        -Low threshold for capacity assessment if elopment risk develops
                                        -Psychiatry will continue to follow

                                        Pt seen with Beth Krautscheid, MS-III, and supervision was provided. Mr. FN136
                                        MN136 LN136 is a 69 yo WM w/ hx of depression and antisocial personality
                                        traits who underwent LAR for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma on 10/3 with
                                        complicated post-op course and delirium.

                                        On my exam, Mr. LN136 is sitting on his bed and engages with the team and
                                        questioning and seeming less irritable than on past interactions (as compared to
                                        note by others). Answers to his name, able to state the date, month, but
                                        incorrectly states that it is 2024 for on two occasions during interview.  He
                                        does know why he is in the hospital and agrees that this is the appropriate
                                        place. Attention seems preserved as he as is able to state the days of the week
                                        backwards. Explicitly denies SI and HI. Reports seeing and interacting with cats
                                        yesterday and last night as well as illusions of numbers on the wall moving
                                        towards him.  No signs of EPS on exam.

                                        Delirium appears to be worsened as compared to MSE in yesterdays notes, thus, I
                                        agree with MS-III Krautscheid's note and recommendations and additionally,
                                        --encourage calm, quiet room at night, open shades and curtains during the day
                                        for exposure to daylight.  Up to chair for meals as tolerated and other
                                        orienting activities.
                                        --psychiatry consult service will continue to follow in his care

                                        Thank you for contacting us to assist in the care of Mr. LN136.

                                        If symptoms worsen overnight please contact psychiatry consult service as
                                        needed. Patient discussed with on call attending Dr. Gramann, who is in

                                        Agree with recommendations, have reviewed case in detail with Beth Kreutschied
                                        MS III and Dr. Mary Lajoy, PGY-5 psychiatry fellow.

                                        - At this time, would continue antipsychotic standing regimen, frequently
                                        monitoring and repleting K, Mg, Ca to minimize risk of QTC prolongation. would

                                        - If symptoms improve, could attempt titration off antipsychotic prior to
                                        discharge. Psychiatry consult team can assist with this.
                                        - Otherwise, if continues to have benefit from standing antipsychotic regimen,

                                        *** MHD - INPAT - PSYCHIATRY CONSULT Has ADDENDA ***

                                        ID / CC: 69 yo M who developed delirium 2 weeks s/p LAR for rectal
                                        adenocarcinoma was transferred to 5C on court hold, improved on Haldol so
                                        transferred to 9D with court hold removed, developed worsening delirium after
                                        Haldol cessation.

                                        S: Since restarting on Haldol, hallucinations and delusions of cats have ceased.
                                        In fact Mr. LN136 does not recall ever seeing cats, "just people."
                                        Yesterday, however, he reported that his therapeutic companion was throwing
                                        pennies at him and was becoming increasingly agitated, refused all of his
                                        nighttime medications including Haldol. This morning, accepted his medications
                                        but has remained agitated. He is irritable and hostile toward psychiatric team
                                        this morning, does not understand need for our involvement and is not
                                        participatory during our interview. Expresses frustration that he may require a
                                        feeding tube, feels this is "punishment for being sick." He wishes that he could
                                        go home, knows that this would not be safe for his health. Did not comply with
                                        further questioning this morning.

                                        General appearance: Unkempt man appears stated age, sleeping in his bed in the
                                        dark and awakens easily. Disheveled hair and beard, wearing hospital top and
                                        bottoms.
                                        Behavior and psychomotor activity: Intense eye contact, remains laying in bed
                                        with large hand gestures. No obvious rigidity.
                                        Language and speech: Fast, loud, slightly slurred, irritable.
                                        Thought Process: Linear.
                                        Content: Not actively hallucinating. Did not assess SI, HI.
                                        Mood: Irritated
                                        Affect: Hostile, intense.
                                        Judgment: Questionable. Desire to leave hopsital before he is well seems to be
                                        stemming from his anxiety about having a feeding tube. He does not answer
                                        directly when we ask if he actually plans to leave.
                                        Insight: Fair. Understands implications of feeding tube.
                                        Cognition: Oriented to date, month. Required multiple choice to remember that it
                                        is 2014.

                                        Impression:
                                        Mr. LN136 is a 69 year old male veteran who has had fluctuating mental
                                        status 2/2 delirium in setting of complicated post-op recovery who again
                                        developed hallucinations and illusions 10/24 after haloperidol was d/c'd.
                                        Today, unable to fully assess Mr. LN136 given irritability and lack of
                                        compliance with interview. He is oriented and not hallucinating during our visit
                                        however has well-documented fluctuating sxs over the last two days consistent
                                        with diagnosis of delirium. Delirium likely of multifactorial etiology, may have
                                        underlying neurocognitive disorder contributing. Appropriate workup has been
                                        initiated with findings of anemia and hypomagnesemia. Note pt has also been
                                        hypoxic which, when combined with anemia, could be causing delirium due to
                                        decreased oxygen delivery to his brain. Recommend supplemental O2 if pt remains
                                        hypoxic. Still could benenfit from UA to r/o UTI as additional contributing
                                        factor.
                                        At this time would recommend continuation of Haldol 1mg PO BID, could supplement
                                        this PRN agitation. As haldol increases risk for prolonged QT, should obtain
                                        repeat EKG, monitor Mg and K and replete as needed. When anticipating d/c, would
                                        be best to try to taper Haldol. However, if seems unsafe to do so with agitation
                                        and continued delirium could continue Haldol with close outpatient mental health
                                        f/u.
                                        Mr. LN136 has repeatedly stated that he plans to stay in the hospital for

                                        Recommendations:
                                        -Continue haloperidol 1mg PO BID with 0.5 mg PO or 0.25mg IV q4h PRN agitation
                                        (not to exceed 4mg total per day)
                                        -When aprroaching d/c, attempt to taper Haldol. If need for Haldol remains (i.e.
                                        continued delirium and agitation), could continue this  but will require close
                                        mental health followup as an outpatient.
                                        -Due to risk of prolonged QT, order EKG, follow Mg and K while on Haldol
                                        -Continue workup for potential causes of new/worsening delirium - still need UA
                                        -Therapeutic companion at nursing discretion
                                        -Continue behavioral interventions including frequent reorientation,
                                        reassurance, light exposure during day.
                                        -Low threshold for capacity assessment if elopment risk develops
                                        -Psychiatry will sign off at this time.

                                        Patient seen and examined with MS3 student Beth Krautscheid.  Agree with her
                                        above note.  Briefly, pt. with delirium, s/p complicated course after LAR of
                                        rectosigmoid carcinoma,  briefly admitted to 5C on court hold, now back on
                                        medical service.  Pt. has been tolerating haloperidol 1mg BID well without
                                        adverse effect.  Would continue this medication for now and pt. should be
                                        assessed after his delirium clear whether this medication should be continued.
                                        This can be done either while inpatient by the primary team or by an outpatient
                                        provider.  If necessary pt. can be referred to geropsychiatry for medication
                                        assessment after discharge.  There are no acute safety concerns that would
                                        warrant higher level of care at this time.

                                        *** MHD - INPAT - PSYCHIATRY CONSULT Has ADDENDA ***

                                        ID / CC: 69 yo M who developed delirium 2 weeks s/p LAR for rectal
                                        adenocarcinoma was transferred to 5C on court hold, improved on Haldol so
                                        transferred to 9D with court hold removed now with delirium worsening after
                                        Haldol cessation.

                                        S: Per nursing, Mr. LN136 slept through the night, has not reported any
                                        further hallucinations, and has been oriented.  There is a therapeutic companion
                                        in the room who states that he has appeared sleepy and has occasionally shouted
                                        out random things.  He denies any auditory or visual hallucinations today.  He
                                        states that he has had hallucinations in the past when he has "put himself in
                                        the position to" but that he is not put in that position now.  He was unable to
                                        clarify what position this might be.  He also denied any hallucinations
                                        regarding cats/kittens.  He feels that he didn't sleep well last night, and
                                        endorses being sleepy today.

                                        sleepy.  On memory testing, remembered different words likely from previous
                                        mental status exam.

                                        Impression:
                                        Mr. LN136 is a 69 year old male veteran who has had fluctuating mental
                                        status 2/2 delirium in setting of complicated post-op recovery who again
                                        developed hallucinations and illusions 10/24 after haloperidol was d/c'd.
                                        Mr. LN136 is mostly oriented today, felt it was the 24th but did know it was
                                        Sunday (possibly from cues from NFL on TV).  Per his nurse and therapeutic
                                        companion, he has been oriented and exhibited no impulsivity or behavioral
                                        dyscontrol, though has been reported that he has called out which may be 2/2
                                        hallucinations or dreams.  He does appear fatigued, and exhibits some
                                        attentional deficit that was not there per prior notes.  He may be experiencing
                                        a hypoactive state in his delirium.  He also received 10mg oxycodone
                                        approximately 4 hours before, and haloperidol two hours before, which may be
                                        contributing to sedation.

                                        Overall, Mr. LN136 seems to have responded well to reinitiation of
                                        haloperidol.  He is oriented to month/year, place, person and he is no longer
                                        reporting any hallucinations.  He continues to be a low risk of elopement in his
                                        current hypoactive state.

                                        There are no signs of rigidity, dyskinesia, akathisia on exam today.

                                        Thank you for requesting our continued involvement in Mr. LN136's care, we
                                        will continue to follow.

                                        Recommendations:
                                        -continue as you are doing, recommendations as per last consult note:
                                        -haloperidol 1mg PO BID
                                        -Pursue aggressive workup for potential causes of new/worsening delirium (UA,
                                        head CT, TSH in addition to LFTs, CBC and CMP which you have already been
                                        checking)
                                        -Therapeutic companion at nursing discretion
                                        -Low threshold for capacity assessment if elopment risk develops
                                        -Psychiatry will continue to follow

                                        Patient discussed with my supervising practitioner and C/L attending Dr. Stacey
                                        Gramann, who is in agreement with the assessment and plan.

                                        Called by nursing staff, alerted to an increase in agitation just after original
                                        recommendations made, with patient claiming that his TC was throwing pennies at
                                        him.  This is likely reflective of the fluctuating course of delirium.

                                        Would add to recommendations:
                                        -can give 0.5mg haloperidol PO q4h PRN for agitation along with scheduled 1mg
                                        BID, NTE add'l 2mg (for 4mg total per day)
                                        -if refuses PO, consider IV haloperidol 0.25mg IV q4h PRN for agitation, NTE
                                        add'l 1mg.

                                        ID / CC: 69 year old MALE with hx of depression and antisocial personality
                                        d/o in hospital s/p LAR for rectal adenocarcinoma 10/3 with complicated post-op
                                        course who was placed on court hold 10/20 after developing acute delirium; now
                                        significantly improved mental status and voluntary.

                                        S: Mr. LN136's court hold was removed and he was moved to the 9th floor
                                        yesterday, therapeutic companion also stopped. Since then, pt has been
                                        "cooperative" per nursing staff. The psychiatry team met Mr. LN136 this
                                        morning as he was walking back from the smoking room downstairs accompanied by a
                                        CNA. Transferred easily into comfortable position in bed and was much more awake
                                        and conversant than in prior visits. States that his memory is still only 65-70%
                                        back to normal but that it has certainly improved and that he feels he could
                                        care for himself independently "if I had to." He agrees with need to stay here
                                        in the hospital for the sake of his health as recommended by his primary team.
                                        Continues to describe his mood as "irritated" but has been eating and sleeping
                                        well (aside from interruptions by staff). Explicitly denies hallucinations, SI,
                                        HI.

                                        Impression: 69 year old MALE with hx of depression and antisocial personality
                                        d/o who was placed on court hold and transferred to 5c in setting of acute
                                        delirium 2 weeks s/p LAR for rectal adenocarcinoma. Now with improved cognition
                                        on Haldol, court hold removed and returned to 9th floor.
                                        Delirium is significantly improved compared to prior as evidenced by staff
                                        reports and improved interaction and cognition on exam today. By nature,
                                        delirium fluctuates and can take up to months to resolve. Would recommend that
                                        staff be aware and make note of delirious sxs, give final Haldol dose tonight
                                        then d/c tomorrow if remains asymptomatic.
                                        In reviewing chart, pt has been irritable but consistently oriented and has not
                                        threatened to leave hospital since onset of his delirium 3 nights ago. He has
                                        appropriate insight regarding need to stay in hospital at the recommendation of
                                        his primary team. Thus, feel he is appropriate to remain on 9th floor without
                                        court hold. At this time, psychiatry team will sign off. Please do not hesitate
                                        to contact us with further questions or concerns. Thank you for involving us in
                                        this interesting case.

                                        Recommendations:
                                        -Give Haldol 1mg tonight then d/c tomorrow if remains asymptomatic
                                        -Continue to document s/s of delirium
                                        -Psychiatry sign off

                                        10/23 EKG: QTc 424

                                        Impression: 69 year old MALE with hx of depression and antisocial personality
                                        d/o in hospital s/p LAR for rectal adenocarcinoma 10/3 with complicated post-op
                                        course who developed acute delirium 10/20, was transferred to 5C and currently
                                        on court hold.
                                        Delirium continues to fluctuate but is overall improved as evidenced by staff
                                        reports and improved interaction and cognition on exam today. Etiology of his
                                        delirium is likely multifactorial with most likely contributing factors being
                                        renal insufficiency, urinary retention, constipation, hypoxia, anemia, pain,
                                        possible infection. Most other causes of delirium have been adequately assessed
                                        though if delirium persists, would recommend head CT to evaluate for acute
                                        neuro changes as another possible etiology. Notably, pt may have underlying
                                        mild neurocognitive d/o that predisposes him to delirium. Recommed this be
                                        further evaluated as an outpt after delirium resolution.
                                        In reviewing chart, pt has been irritable but has not threatened to leave
                                        hospital since onset of his delirium 3 nights ago. He has appropriate insight
                                        regarding need to stay in hospital at the recommendation of his primary team.
                                        Thus, feel court hold no longer necessary and that transfer to 9th floor with
                                        continued therapeutic companion is reasonable at this time. Recommend that
                                        primary team maintain scheduled haldol at current dose (QTc, K and Mg all wnl;
                                        continue to monitor) given steady regression of sxs. Appreciate staff attention
                                        to and documentation of delirious sxs, we will continue to follow.


                                        Recommendations:
                                        -Transfer to 9th floor is reasonable
                                        -Recommend continue therapeutic companion
                                        -Continue scheduled Haldol PO 1mg BID with EKG, K+ and Mg++ daily while on this
                                        medication.
                                        -Staff to document s/s of delirium
                                        -If delirium persists or worsens, obtain head CT to r/o acute neuro changes as
                                        possible etiology
                                        -Psychiatry will continue to follow

                                        10/23/2014 ADDENDUM                      STATUS: COMPLETED
                                        Mr. LN136 was seen and evaluated by myself along with Nancy Haller and
                                        medical student Beth Krautscheid.  I agree with the assessment and plan as
                                        stated above.  On my exam, the veteran was tired and disheveled in hospital
                                        pajamas and lying in bed under his bed sheets.  He was cooperative, though
                                        irritable with intermittent intense eye contact.  No cogwheel rigidity or EPS on
                                        exam. He was fluent, loud and had a linear and future oriented thought process.
                                        No SI/HI/violent thoughts and no perceptual disturbances.  He remains irritable
                                        (though likely that is his baseline).  Aware that he is in hospital, knows
                                        month, year, president and that he is in the hospital for surgery on his
                                        "colon".  He did not know the date. Can name days of the week backwards
                                        correctly.


                                        FN136 MN136 LN136 is a 69 yo WM  s/p LAR and exlap d/t dehiscence with
                                        delirium who was placed on a NMI and transferred to med/psych bed on 5C. His
                                        mental status is improving in that the veteran is more alert/attentive and has
                                        been in behavioral control and adherent with treatment.  History of chart may
                                        suggest history of neurocognitive disorder.

                                        - Veteran agrees and supports need for ongoing medical care. Will discontinue
                                        NMI (hospital hold).
                                        - Discontinuation of NMI paperwork completed and provided to hospital clerical
                                        staff on 9th floor
                                        - Support move of veteran to surgical ward.  He benefits from close observation
                                        by nursing staff.
                                        - Continue Haldol 1 mg BID for now.
                                        - Recommend future consideration of head CT and TSH, RPR, HIV, Vitamin D to
                                        obtain while in the hospital as this may be easier to obtain while the veteran
                                        is hospitalized and would be helpful should he be referred in the future to
                                        dementia clinic
                                        - We will continue to follow along with you.

                                        Recommendations were communicated to the primary team (GS1) this morning.

                                        Case was discussed with supervising attending, Dr. Linda Ganzini, who agrees
                                        with the assessment and plan as documented above.

                                        ID / CC: FN136 MN136 LN136 is a 69 year old MALE with hx of depressiona nd
                                        antisocial personality disorder who developed acute delirium on 10/20 in setting

                                        Impression: 69 year old MALE with hx of depression and antisocial personality
                                        d/o who developed acute delirium in the setting of complicated post-op stay 2
                                        weeks s/p LAP for rectal adenocarcinoma, currently on court hold.
                                        His cognitive status seems to be fluctuating as is typical of this delirious
                                        process. Cause of delirium not fully elucidated as of yet though is believed to
                                        be a medical process for which appropriate investigation is underway. Urinary
                                        retention and constipation likely contributors. He notably has a hx of mild
                                        cognitive impairment which has not been fully evaluated but could be
                                        contributing to susceptibility to delirium during this stay. For this reason,
                                        lab workup for dementia has been initiated and should have cognitive testing
                                        after delirium has resolved. On scheduled haloperidol, his cognition does seem
                                        to be improving both subjectively and objectively and he has not made any
                                        elopement attempts. He also states that he is agreeable to staying in the
                                        hospital if deemed medically necessary by his primary team. However, as delirium
                                        is fluctuating and we have yet to elucidate clear cause, concern that he may
                                        again pose threat to himself or others in case of acute worsening. Thus, feel he
                                        should remain on 5C with therapeutic companion. We appreciate further input from
                                        staff regarding delirious sxs and will
                                        continue to follow.

                                        Recommendations:

                                        10/22/2014 ADDENDUM                      STATUS: COMPLETED
                                        Pt seen with Beth Krautscheid, MS-III, and supervision has been provided. Mr.
                                        FN136 MN136 LN136 is a 69 yo WM  s/p LAR and exlap d/t dehiscence currently
                                        with deliruim who was placed on a NMI and transfered to med/psych bed on 5C.
                                        Psychiatry originally consulted for assessment and treatment of delirium. After
                                        reviewing recent notes, Mr. LN136's delirium appears to be modestly improved
                                        . Mr. LN136 was found lying in his bed and with his eyes closed. He was
                                        irritable, but generally cooperative with interview. Improved orientation
                                        (answers to name, day of the month, month, that he is in the PVAMC, and
                                        situation), however continues to struggle with attentional tasks and struggled
                                        with remaining awake during interview; suggesting that Delirium is ongoing.

                                        -Recognize the staffing strain that having Mr. LN136 on 5C creates, however
                                        given his current presentation feel that it is prudent to have Mr. LN136
                                        remain on 5C in med/psych bed, and with NMI (hospital hold) in place, given that
                                        he remains an elopment risk given his ongoing delirium/Neurocognitive deficit.
                                        -Would reduce his Haldol to Haldol PO 1MG BID.
                                        -Would obtain a CT head to ruleout acute neurologic changes as possible eitology
                                        of his Delirium
                                        -Psychiatry will continue to follow

                                        PRIOR LEVEL OF FUNCTION:  OT last saw this patient on 10-8-14.  He was willing
                                        to participate only minimally.  Per his report on that date:  Reluctant

                                        SUBJECTIVE: "Why do I have to get up?"

                                        OBJECTIVE: Patient lying flat, supine in bed, on RA when OT initiated the
                                        session.  Psychiatry had just seen the patient.  He is currently on 5C and on a
                                        court hold.

                                        Activities of Daily Living (ADLS):  unable to test.  Patient declines to
                                        participate.

                                        Eating: 10-22-14 albumin 3.0.  Patient subjectively appears to have lost weight.

                                        writer.  He is likely being given sponge baths due to his abdominal incision and

                                        Functional Cognition: Orientation NT.  Closes eyes tightly to shut out this
                                        writer.  Declines to participate and is adamant.  OT did not continue to cajole
                                        patient after education was provided r/t the purpose/ reason that activity after
                                        surgery is needed and requested by his doctors.

                                        TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROVIDED THIS DATE:  education re:  importance of
                                        getting OOB.

                                        ASSESSMENT:  69 y/o male s/p abdominal surgeries x 2 who has consistently
                                        declined participation with OT in spite of education provided, cajoling,
                                        promises to assist, etc.  Recommend ICF level of care.  Patient is reportedly
                                        going to the CLC, where he likely will need to stay until his wounds heal.
                                        Having him at the CLC will facilitate closer psychiatric f/u which will benefit
                                        patient.  Patient likely will need placement in LTC after delirium clears and
                                        decision making capacity r/t d/c planning can be evaluated.  OT to sign off now
                                        given patient is consistently declining participation.


                                        PLAN: D/C OT

                                        EQUIPMENTS NEEDS: none now
                                        D/C RECOMMENDATIONS:  ICF level of care until he no longer has abdominal
                                        precautions and mentation clears to his unknown baseline.  If he demonstrates an
                                        ability to participate/cooperate at the CLC, recommend OT consult.
                                        COORDINATION OF CARE:  nursing, Psychiatry service.

                                        This note is to serve as a discharge summary if no additional occupational
                                        therapy services are provided or patient discharges from the hospital prior to

                                        History of Present Illness:
                                        Mr. LN136 is a 69 yo M with hx of CAD s/p 3v CABG who is POD#18 s/p
                                        Lower Anterior Resection for rectal adenocarcinoma now on court hold after
                                        developing AMS with impulsivity last night.
                                        Since his Lower Anterior Resection on 10/3, hospital complications have included
                                        fascial dehiscence requiring exploratory laparotomy and repair and subsequent
                                        development of hypoxia necessitating ICU admission. Became septic and was
                                        subsequently started on Zosyn. Infection improved and was scheduled for d/c to
                                        CLC (per SW note), however had decreased UOP so was kept in the hospital. On
                                        10/20 at 2300, became suddenly agitated and threatened to leave. Was
                                        experiencing visual hallucinations of soldiers, children and police in his room
                                        and paranoia, expressing fear that his nurse had a gun. Per RN report, was
                                        pulling at his lines and inconsolable. Was subsequently transferred to the
                                        Med/Psych room on 5C for further management.
                                        Today, pt is agitated and claims that the "other team" is working
                                        against him by controlling his care in the hospital. He is initially unwilling
                                        to engage in conversation with the psychiatry team, is hostile and challenges
                                        team members. When asked how he is sleeping, answers "with my eyes closed," does
                                        endorse good appetite "when I wanna eat." Became less agitated and more
                                        compliant after his RN volunteered to go buy him a rootbeer float. Hesitantly
                                        offers information about his last day in the hospital including that he was
                                        seeing things (particularly a court hearing) last night that he could not
                                        discern from reality but has since gathered were not real. Denies auditory or
                                        olfactory hallucinations.

                                        Assessment:
                                        Mr. LN136 is a 69 yo M with hx of CAD s/p 3v CABG who is POD#18 s/p
                                        Lower Anterior Resection for rectal adenocarcinoma now on court hold after
                                        developing AMS with impulsivity last night most c/w a delirious episode.
                                        Has had visual hallucinations, now resolved, as well as fluctuating cognition
                                        which support dx of delirium. Biologically, is admitted with medical
                                        complications that could be contributing to delirium. Had a recent infection
                                        (presumed abdominal) which was treated with Zosyn, clean UA and WBC returned to
                                        normal today however could still have underlying infection with ostomy being
                                        potential route. Asterixis on exam is reassuring that this is likely due to an
                                        acute medical condition as opposed to a chronic neurocognitive disorder; should
                                        check LFT and ammonia to assess. Electrolytes with slightly elevated
                                        BUN/Creatinine suggesting AKI as a potential etiology. Electrolytes o/w
                                        unremarkable. Had normal B12 and Folate earlier this year however will need to
                                        check TSH, RPR, HIV and Vitamin D in order to more fully evaluate for medical
                                        causes. He is on a nasal cannula inconsistently and had ABG with low pO2 so
                                        hypoxia may be contributing factor. Reporting that his abdomen hurts, pain is
                                        also known to precipitate delirium at times. Also consider pancreatitis with
                                        amylase and lipase. He has significant cardiac hx with recent CP concerning for
                                        MI, troponin and EKG normal so this is less likely the cause of his AMS.
                                        Psychologically, has underlying mild cognitive impairment per chart review which
                                        place him at higher risk of delirium. Socially is at risk for delirium as he has
                                        been displaced from his regular environment during this prolonged hospital stay.
                                        As delirium is a fluctuating process that frequently worsens at night,
                                        concerned for pt's safety and will need to maintain on court hold here with 1:1
                                        supervision overnight. Filed new court hold form. Given stability after 3mg
                                        Haldol today, recommend scheduled doses tonight, tomorrow morning and tomorrow
                                        at noon. Request that staff document delirious sxs overnight. Psychiatry team
                                        will reassess tomorrow for immediate concerns (hallucinations, SI, HI,
                                        medication side effects) tomorrow and plan for outpt f/u to assess for cognitive
                                        impairment once delirium has resolved and is medically stable for d/c.

                                        Recommendations:
                                        -Haldol 2.5mg Qpm, 1mg at 0800 and 1 mg at noon
                                        -Check repeat EKG, follow K+ and Mg++ while on Haldol
                                        -LFTs, Ammonia, Amylase, Lipase r/o other possible delirium etiologies
                                        -Is an elopement risk, maintain 1:1 RN care on 5C tonight
                                        -Repeat assessment tomorrow to assess for SI, HI, medication side effects
                                        -Will place referral for outpt Geri Psych f/u to assess cognitive impairment

                                        Diagnosis:
                                        Delirium
                                        Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder

                                        10/21/2014 ADDENDUM                      STATUS: COMPLETED
                                        Patient seen with MS3 Beth Krautschied and supervision provided.  Briefly, Mr.
                                        LN136 is a 69 year old male with past psychiatric history notable for
                                        depressive symptoms and unclear prior cognitive impairment, now admitted for
                                        rectal surgery for CA diagnosis.  This procedure complicated by wound
                                        dehiescience, later chest pain, and finally agitation with demands to discharge
                                        from the hospital with episodes of pulling at surgical lines.  He was
                                        transferred to the med/psych bed on 5c, placed on NMI hold, and treated with
                                        total of 3 mg haldol over 16 hours.  Since that time, reports from nursing staff
                                        indicate that he has been somewhat more calm, although refusing medications at
                                        times.  Psychiatry service consulted for recommendations regarding investigation
                                        of causes of delirium, as well as medication recommendations on how to manage
                                        episodic agitation.

                                        On my exam, patient is 69 year old male who appears stated age, dressed in
                                        hospital clothes.  Initially sleeping, but awakes to loud voice and gentle tap
                                        on leg.  Generally cooperative with exam, though at times declines to
                                        participate in mental status exam.  Speech normal rate, rhythm, tone and volume.
                                        Thought process mostly logical and goal-directed, though at times diverges onto
                                        tangents which are not always clear to interviewers.  Thought content notable
                                        for reports of possible visual hallucinations over past 24 hours, though none
                                        notable on this exam.  No SI/HI.  Mood is fair, affect vaguely anxious.
                                        Cognition grossly impaired; notable for limited orientation to time (October,
                                        does not know year/date).  Formal testing not completed at this time.  Insight
                                        fair, judgment limited.

                                        At this time, presentation most consistent with delirium.  Possible additional
                                        component of underlying dementia, though lack of clear baseline cognitive
                                        assessment makes this hard to clarify.  Recent agitation makes for difficult
                                        treatment of medical conditions.  Given this, would agree with ongoing NMI.

                                        Completed NMI form again, given concerns from MC ICP, per GS team report.  Would
                                        also recommend standing haldol: 1 mg daily at 8am and noon, 2.5 mg qHS.
                                        Continue to monitor EKG (for QTc prolongation) and K, Mg.  Continue to work up
                                        causes of delirium - would agree with possible abdominal CT, would also
                                        recommend LFTs, ammonia, lipase, amylase.

                                        Psychiatry consult service will continue to follow.  This case discussed with,
                                        and patient seen with, Todd Eisenberg, attending psychiatrist, who agrees with
                                        the above assessment and plan.

                                        Asked by surgery service to evaluate Veteran for assessment and management of
                                        confusion, agitation, psychotic sx's.  Reviewed chart.  Evaluated Veteran c
                                        geriatric psychiatry fellow Dr. Wilson -- please see his note dated today for
                                        full details of hpi, past hx, social hx, labs/tests.

                                        In brief, this is a 69y/o male c psychiatric hx notable for past dx of
                                        antisocial personality d/o (dx made during inpatient psychiatric hospitalization
                                        in 1995, but records from that admission not immediately available, so do not
                                        know rationale for that dx), depression (dx of mdd v mood d/o secondary to CAD),
                                        delirium (during 2006 admission for ARF and rhabdo), and ?baseline cognitive
                                        deficits (although we could not locate any formal cognitive exams, there was a
                                        suspicion of a "mild cognitive disorder" in previous outpatient psychiatric
                                        evaluations.

                                        Now, he is admitted to the surgical service for LAR c diverting ileostomy for a
                                        rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma (currently POD#18).  Post-op course c/b fascial
                                        dehiscence necessitating ex-lap and repair; sepsis; hypoxia, oliguria.

                                        Last noc, Veteran appeared to be at baseline during evening shift (per nursing
                                        notes).  Then, at 11PM, he exhibited psychotic sx's (hallucinosis of soldiers,
                                        children, and police; persecutory delusions that nurse had a gun, that his life
                                        was in danger), agitation, and confusion (disoriented, fluctuating mental
                                        status).  He received 25mg of quetiapine last noc, 2mg IV haldol at 0948 and 1mg
                                        IV haldol at 1130.  Fluctuation of level of arousal/confusional sx's persists
                                        and Veteran has been pulling at ostomy site and IV.

                                        Veteran has a limited recall of events of last noc and today.  However, he does
                                        acknowledge confusion and suspects he was hallucinating.

                                        Vitals: 97.8  HR 76  BP 148/83  R 20  Wt 199.6 lbs

                                        Initially quite confused but thought process/clarity improved after several
                                        minutes of discussion.  Speech normal rate, volume, tone.  Thought initially
                                        confused with tangential/disconnected answers to questions, but after ~5 minutes
                                        thought was fairly linear and goal-directed.  Believes he likely had VH's last

                                        not know where he was or why he was here.  After clearing somewhat remembered

                                        Attn:  Max digit span forward 5; bkwds 3.  DOWB intact.
                                        Cognitive exam limited by Veteran's reluctance to engage in what he thought were
                                        "games".

                                        PE:  Minimal rigidity of LUE&gt;RUE.  Mild/mod resting tremor and +asterixis.

                                        Imp: 69y/o male c psychiatric hx notable for historical dx of depression and
                                        antisocial personality d/o.  Also with h/o possible baseline cognitive deficits
                                        and with clear h/o delirium.  Now, in context of recovery from LAR c diverting
                                        ileostomy for rectosigmoid andenocarcinoma with a complicated post-op course,
                                        Veteran clearly exhibited sx's c/w delirium (agitation, psychosis, confusion)
                                        last noc and today.  2/3 of individuals c delirium have underlying dementia --
                                        thus, he is at some risk for having dementia despite our being unable to
                                        adequately evaluate for possible dementia in context of resolving delirium.  For
                                        now, would continue to w/u potential medical causes of delirium as you are
                                        doing.  Would work to avoid subsequent acute exacerbations of agitated delirium
                                        by converting to standing haloperidol regimen (may keep PRN's, but preferable to
                                        "stay ahead" of delirium with standing dose).

                                        Plan:
                                        1)  Add'l delirium lab w/u:
                                        LFT's, ammonia, amylase, lipase
                                        (agree with your plan for abdominal CT)
                                        2)  Dementia lab w/u (although not emergently needed, would be helpful to get
                                        in-house as there are a number of potentially reversible causes of baseline
                                        cognitive deficits/dementia that are yet to be ruled out):
                                        TSH, RPR, HIV, Vitamin D
                                        3)  Repeat EKG to look for QT prolongation.
                                        4)  STANDING Haloperidol 1mg IV @ 0800 &amp; 1200.
                                        Haloperidol 2.5mg IV qHS
                                        Will adjust standing dose based on response.  If requiring PRN's, will add
                                        amount required in PRN's to standing regimen.  If delirium improves, will start
                                        to taper.
                                        5)  Agree c med-psych bed for now.  Will continue to follow c you.

                                        precautions.  Asked for his glasses and when OT provided his glasses, did not
                                        initiate putting them on so OT read the abdominal precaution written handout to
                                        him.  Very irritable and appears discouraged.  Appears uncomfortable when
                                        looking at his ostomy and rapidly covers it up if exposed.  Capable of following
                                        1 step commands if he so chooses.  Initially denies that he has been offered SNF
                                        but later agrees to go.  Irritable when talking about his chronic pain (back,
                                        knee):  "there is nothing they can do about it".

                                        TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROVIDED THIS DATE:  bed mobility, introduced use of
                                        reacher with patient demonstrating correct use, sit to stand, self feeding.
                                        Discussed other equipment to help reach his feet.  Written/verbal/practice
                                        education r/t abdominal precautions.

                                        ASSESSMENT:  69 y/o male POD 3 s/p rom LAR on 10/3/14.  patient is irritable and
                                        appears discouraged.  Decreased cooperation.  Required min (a) supine to sit.
                                        Declines to learn use of most of the equipment OT offered to help him adhere to
                                        abdominal precautions.  Sleeps on a mattress on the floor at home which will
                                        make adhering to abdominal precautions unlikely.  Patient can benefit from
                                        continued acute OT services and he does agree to SNF rehab stay.

                                        Pt ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN AND AGREED TO GOAL SETTING:  yes

                                        LTG date:  patient will participate in ADL/mobility task performance
                                        independently and without LOB within 2 weeks from this
                                        evaluation date.

                                        PLAN: OT to see 1 X week to address the above goals.  MD may wish to consider
                                        Psych consult to eval for r/o depression vs personality style as barrier to
                                        participation.

                                        EQUIPMENTS NEEDS:  OT provided a reacher today.  Will provide
                                        other needed equipment for ADL performance at SNF, if patient
                                        agrees to attempt use of equipment.
                                        D/C RECOMMENDATIONS:  SNF level rehab X 2 weeks with OT to see 6 X week
                                        for ADL and IADLs compensatory strategy training.  Patient agrees to
                                        go.

                                            SUMMARY:
                                            (ABBREVIATED HPI, PE, AND PERTINENT LABS)
                                            EVENTS LEADING TO CLC ADMISSION
                                            10/3    PVAMC: Low-anterior resection (LAR) for rectal ca, with end-to-end
                                            colorectal anastomosis, and loop ileostomy; postop wound dehiscence; delirium;
                                            consultation by Psychiatry; studies noncontrib.; haloperidol added
                                            10/10   Closure of abdominal wound dehiscence (except inferior aspect)

                                            REASON FOR CLC ADMISSION
                                            For PT and OT and ostomy care training

                                            HOSPITAL COURSE:
                                            CLC course overall: his abdominal wound healed and some residual effects of
                                            PVAMC-related delirium resolved. Evidence emerged of his underlying antisocial
                                            personality disorder including threatening staff and angry-sounding terse
                                            responses. Although these tendencies improved he removed highly resistant to
                                            learning his ostomy care. This presented a serious barrier to discharge despite
                                            efforts of the entire team including psychiatry. During th entire CLC stay he
                                            spent a very large percentage of his time in bed; indeed, essentially the only
                                            time that he elected to be out of bed was to for toileting and to smoke.

                                            He was presented with a discharge date of the day after his Surgery clinic
                                            appointment; with this, he actually began participating somewhat more in
                                            learning his ostomy care and demonstrated ability to empty his bag. He was
                                            offered and encouraged to go on pass as a trial but he refused.

                                            Home health was arranged with agreement to see him day after discharge.

                                        SUMMARY:
                                        Clinical History taken from operative report indications by Dr. Lu on
                                        10/03/2014:

                                        "Patient is a 69-year-old, obese male with a history of
                                        colon polyps.  He underwent a surveillance colonoscopy to the cecum with
                                        an excellent prep on April 29, 2014.  That found a 10 mm ascending
                                        colon lipoma.  There was an 8 mm pedunculated descending colon tubular
                                        adenoma at 30 cm.  That was removed.  The tattoo was placed proximally.
                                        There was an 8 mm sigmoid polyp at 22 cm that was removed but not
                                        retrieved.  There was a 12 mm rectal lesion at 12 cm from the anal verge;
                                        that was removed.  Pathology found a moderately differentiated, focally
                                        poorly differentiated, adenocarcinoma within a tubular adenoma with a
                                        positive margin.  This was positive for lymphovasccular invasion.  This
                                        had been tattooed adjacent to the polyp.  There was a white stippled
                                        lesion lateral to the base of the polyp.  Biopsy was benign.

                                        Staging MRI of the pelvis on June 20, 2014 found a T2 lesion at 7 cm from
                                        the anal verge.  N0.  There was no extramural vascular invasion.  A CT
                                        scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with oral and IV contrast on May
                                        12, 2014 found a 1.3 cm hypervascular lesion within the left liver lobe.
                                        There was a 2 cm lesion of the posterior liver dome.  Those was consistent
                                        with benign liver hemangiomas and have been unchanged from a prior
                                        examination on July 29, 2004.  There are no clear liver or lung
                                        metastases.

                                        AT this point, I saw the patient and performed a rigid proctoscopy
                                        on September 10, 2014.  I found tattoo but no lesion at 11.5 cm from the
                                        anal verge.  Hence, he has at least an mri T2 N 0M0 malignant polyp at
                                        approximately 11.5 cm from the anal verge.

                                        I offered a low anterior resection.  He needed to be cleared by
                                        Cardiology who saw him on September 16, 2014.  They felt no further
                                        workup was recommended; however, they did recommend that he take his
                                        prescribed medications including his Metoprolol, aspirin, and
                                        lisinopril.

                                        Patient was admitted yesterday.  He underwent an oral antibiotic and
                                        mechanical bowel prep.  He comes today for the above procedure."


                                        HOSPITAL COURSE:
                                        1. Rectal Cancer s/p LAR with loop ileostomy on 10/03: Mr. LN136 was
                                        taken to the operating room on 10/03 for the aforementioned procedures,
                                        tolerated the operation well, had no apparent complications, had an
                                        uneventful recovery from anesthetic, and was transferred to the ward for
                                        routine postoperative care.  His initial postopertive course was
                                        uncomplicated and progressed his diet, return of bowel function, ilesotomy
                                        output, and wound healing appropriately. However, on POD#7 he developed acute
                                        abdominal pain, clear drainage from his midline incision, and eviscerated on
                                        the floor. He was taken urgently to the operating room for exploratory
                                        laparotomy with fascial closure. Postoperatively he was unable to wean off of
                                        mechanical ventilation and was requiring pressor therapy to maintain his
                                        postoperative blood pressures so he was transferred to the ICU.  Pressors
                                        were discontinued upon arrival to the ICU and both mechanical ventilation and
                                        tube feeds were discontinued on POD#2 s/p exlap and closure. Due to the
                                        nature of his case and the presence of leukocytosis on routine postop labs,
                                        he had a 7 day course of IV zosyn but was never septic and never developed an
                                        intraabdominal infection. He was transferred out of the unit 3 days after his
                                        fascial closure and continued to have an uncomplicated recovery from a
                                        surgical standpoint.  His ostomy output quickly stabilized and his wound was
                                        left to heal by secondary intention with BID wet to dry dressing changes.

                                        2. History of CAD s/p CABG in 2007: Mr. LN136 underwent a preop cardioloy
                                        evaluation and was cleared for surgery. He had no intraoperative
                                        cardiopulmonary complications and was started on his home doses of ASA,
                                        metoprolol, and simvastatin on POD#1. He continued to do well from a cardiac
                                        standpoint until his dehiscence and second operation at which time he was
                                        found to have troponinemia. Cardiology was consulted and felt that his
                                        troponinemia represented a Type 2 NSTEMI secondary to demand ischemia
                                        postoperatively and their only recommendations were to increase his daily
                                        dose of simvastatin.  Additionally, on POD#8 from his second procedure he was
                                        transferred to the ICU overnight for chest pain (all workup was negative) and
                                        cardiology was reconsulted and recomended increasing his metoprolol dose.
                                        After this episode, he has had no additional episodes of chest pain on no
                                        additional aberrancies in his cardiac markers.

                                        3. Nutrition: Following his procedures, Mr. LN136 was slow to increase
                                        his po intake and advance his diet with low serum prealbumin levels.
                                        Nutrition was consulted and recommended the following: regular diet, TID
                                        protein/high calorie dietary supplements, and double portions on all meals
                                        with calorie counts. By November 11th, his prealbumin level was within normal
                                        limits at &gt; 23 and he was meeting caloric requirements with his regimen of
                                        supplements and double portions.

                                        4. Psychiatry: Following his second operation, on 10/20/2014 Mr. LN136's
                                        mental status became acutely altered, he became increasingly agitated and
                                        evasive, and he began to refuse all of his cares. Psychiatry was consulted
                                        and he was transferred to the psychiatric ward under a 2 physician hold where
                                        he remained until 10/23. Overall assessment has been that he is simply
                                        evasive and unwilling to participate in interviewing so an official
                                        assessment of his decision making capacity was never performed. Following his
                                        episode of acute altered mental status, he was placed on a tapering regimen
                                        of haloperidol which he will not be discharged on. After returning to the
                                        general surgery ward, he continued to be reticent and somewhat evasive,
                                        however, he generally became more compliant with his cares and postoperative
                                        care. Of note, he did refuse evaluation by the inpatient physical therapy
                                        service prior to hospitalization and was discharged from their service before
                                        they were able to make recommendations.


                                        FUNCTIONAL STATUS:

                                        Activity: No PT recommendations. However, no activity restrictions from a
                                        surgical standpoint. Should wear an abdominal binder for comfort.

                                        Lifting: No hard lifting restrictions at this time as he is already more than
                                        4 weeks out from his most recent fascial closure.

                                        Nutrition: Recommend continuing regular diet, TID protein/calorie supplement
                                        shakes, and calorie counts.

                                        Ostomy: Well managed with stable output. Has received all appropriate
                                        teaching.

                                        Wound: Inferior aspect of midline laparotomy incision healing by secondary
                                        intent. Currently dressing with an ABD and securing in place with an
                                        abdominal binder.

                                        bulging posteriorly may be due to generalized edema hemorrhage.
                                        No destructive osseous lesion. Prior posterior L5 laminectomy and

                                        After a TIME OUT was observed, risks and benefits were explained
                                        to the patient and consent was obtained, IV access was placed,
                                        and Tc 99m sestamibi (Cardiolite) were injected. After a delay,
                                        rest gated SPECT images were obtained.
                                        The patient returned for the stress portion of the exam, and an
                                        EKG, baseline heart rate, blood pressure were done, and serial
                                        heart rate, blood pressure, and EKG tracings were obtained while
                                        0.4 mg of regadenoson (Lexiscan) was injected. Subsequently
                                        Technetium 99m sestamibi (Cardiolite) were injected.

                                        The patient then received 75 mg of aminophylline.

                                        After a delay, gated stress SPECT images were obtained.

                                        A low dose noncontrast nondiagnostic CT for the purposes of
                                        attenuation correction and gross anatomic localization was also
                                        performed.

                                        CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, with contrast, 5/12/2014.

                                        HISTORY: Evaluate for metastases, in patient with proximal rectal
                                        cancer.

                                        COMPARISON: CT chest, dated 2/10/2005 and 7/29/2004; renal
                                        ultrasound, 11/27/2006; abdominal aortic ultrasound, 3/10/2010.
                                        No available prior cross-sectional sectional imaging of
                                        abdomen/pelvis.

                                        TECHNIQUE: Following uneventful intravenous administration of 100
                                        mL of Ultravist-370 and oral barium sulfate suspension, multiple
                                        contiguous axial CT images of chest and abdomen obtained, with
                                        coronal and sagittal reformats. CTDI: 34 mGy; DLP: 1621 mGycm.

                                        FINDINGS:

                                        CHEST:

                                        Respiratory motion degrades images. Moderate centrilobular
                                        emphysema, upper lobe-predominant. Minimal anterior subpleural
                                        left upper lobe groundglass opacities, consistent with
                                        atelectasis versus pleural and parental scarring, adjacent with
                                        respect to coronary artery bypass graft. No change, since
                                        2/10/2005, in minimal linear atelectasis versus scarring within
                                        lingula/left lung base. Lungs otherwise clear.

                                        No effusions or lymphadenopathy. Normal heart size. Status post
                                        coronary artery bypass graft. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.

                                        ABDOMEN/PELVIS:

                                        Diffuse hepatic steatosis. Hypervascular lesions with peripheral
                                        enhancement, measuring up to 1.3 cm in diameter within the
                                        anterior subcapsular left liver lobe (image 89, series 3), and up
                                        to 2.0 cm within the posterior liver dome (image 94, series 3)
                                        are consistent (based on their morphology and enhancement
                                        characteristics) with benign liver hemangiomas; these two liver
                                        hemangiomas are unchanged compared with the CT chest with
                                        contrast from 7/29/2004. No other liver lesions. Liver is normal
                                        in size and smooth in contour. Minimal focal fatty infiltration
                                        at falciform ligament insertion. Biliary tract, gallbladder,
                                        spleen, pancreas, and adrenals unremarkable.

                                        Mild bilateral renal cortical thinning; bilateral renal cysts
                                        (the majority of which are parapelvic; the largest non-parapelvic
                                        cyst is exophytic from the posterior interpolar right kidney).
                                        Tiny, punctate, 2 mm calculus within interpolar left kidney. No
                                        solid renal masses, bilaterally. Bladder nondistended. Severe
                                        prostatomegaly.

                                        Visualized bowel is of normal caliber. Reported rectal cancer not
                                        clearly discernible on current exam. Normal appendix. No ascites
                                        or lymphadenopathy. Extensive atherosclerosis within
                                        nonaneurysmal abdominal aorta (within which there is concentric
                                        mural thrombus within its infrarenal aspect). Principal branch
                                        vessels arising from abdominal aorta appear patent.
                                        Fat-containing periumbilical hernia, that does not contain bowel.

                                        MUSCULOSKELETAL:

                                        Grade 2 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1; discogenic degenerative
                                        changes at L5-S1. Status post posterior spinal fusion at L4-S1,
                                        with bilateral transpedicular screws at each of these levels. No
                                        obvious evidence of hardware loosening or failure. Status post
                                        median sternotomy.  Osteopenia. Bone, healed posterior left
                                        seventh and eighth rib fractures. No destructive bony lesions.
                                        Mild bilateral gynecomastia.



                                        Impression:


                                        No evidence of metastatic disease.

                                        Severe emphysema.

                                        Moderate hiatal hernia.

                                        Hepatic steatosis.

                                        Bilateral renal cortical thinning, in setting of severe
                                        prostatomegaly. Recommend clinical correlation with any signs or
                                        symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction.

                                        Specimen #1, received fresh for frozen section diagnosis, labeled with the
                                        patient's name, social security number and "sigmoid colon and rectum",
                                        consists of a 25.0 cm in length x 2.5 cm in diameter portion of colon and
                                        rectum. The margins are stapled closed on both ends with a stitch marking
                                        the distal portion of the colon. The attached mesenteric fat is abundant,
                                        roughly 3.5 cm thick. The mesorectum is bulky and grossly intact. The
                                        estimated diameter is 5.0 cm and with the mesorectum/true proximal margin
                                        extends up 4.0 cm in length from the distal aspect of the specimen. The
                                        staples are removed from both margins and inked black. The mesorectal
                                        margin is also inked black. On opening of the colon there is a 2.9 x 2.0
                                        cm mucosal tattoo located 1.8 cm from the distal margin. There is a firm
                                        palpable mass at the center of that tattoo estimated to be 0.4 x 0.4 cm.
                                        The lesion is not raised or excoriated. Additionally on the mucosal
                                        surface there is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm mucosal polyp located 3.5 cm from
                                        the proximal margin. Serially sectioning of the lesion reveals a
                                        homogenous firm black cut surface to a lesion as well as an area of
                                        underlying serosal thickening. The firm black lesion does not appear to
                                        grossly invade the muscularis propria. Additionally there is a 0.3 x 0.3
                                        firm nodule on the mucosal surface located 6.5 cm proximal to the inked
                                        lesion and 11.3 cm from distal margin. The attached fat is serially
                                        sectioned and searched for lymph nodes and all possible lymph nodes are
                                        submitted.

                                        security number, and "rectal donut", consists of an unoriented 2.4 x 1.8 x
                                        1.0 cm piece of tan-pink tissue consistent with rectal donut. There is a
                                        2.9 x 1.8 cm piece of skin covering one side of the specimen with a 0.3 cm
                                        in diameter circular opening. The specimen is radially sectioned and
                                        completely submitted.

                                        Part 3 consists of an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
                                        with focal poorly differentiated areas characterized by invasive single
                                        malignant cells. The adenocarcinoma is arising from a tubular adenoma.
                                        Also there are foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion. Part 3
                                        received intradepartmental consultation by Dr. Kirsten Woolf who concurs
                                        with the above diagnosis for part 3. The results were discussed with Dr.
                                        Judith Collins on 5/1/2014.

                                        1. You must be logged into CPRS.

                                        There is a moderate obstructive lung defect. Lung volumes are within normal
                                        limits. There is a moderate decrease in diffusing capacity, which may in part be
                                        due to reduced lung volume at time of testing. Compared to 2007, slight
                                        worsening of obstruction.
